Problem solving through widgets in an Ionic app!

*This is basically just a dev box, adding cool widgets in the morning when bored...*

Alright, yet another simple Ionic app. This one is just a box full of randomly helpful widgets that the user can access and use.

###All You Have To Do...

1. Clone the repo in whatever way you prefer. (ZIP download, `git clone`, <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">Desktop</a>, etc)

2. Run `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure all deps are up to date!

3. Run `ionic serve` (or use <a href="http://lab.ionic.io" target="_blank">Ionic Lab</a>) to start local server.

4. Go to `localhost:8100` and enjoy the awesomeness of *livereload*
